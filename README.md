# AddressBook
This program allows the user to create an address book.
The program will be able to store the user’s contact information such as their first name,
last name, phone number, and address. Not only is the user able to store a contact’s information,
but they can also edit, search, display, and delete the entry of a contract. The number of contacts 
is displayed below the menu so the user can keep track of the number of contacts they have.
